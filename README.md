# Challenge1 - Horiseon HTML/CSS updates

The purpose of this project was to make our Horiseon site more accessbile for people with disabilities.  Allowing for our visitors to use assistive technologies such as:

* video captions
* screen readers
* braille keyboards

Due to some of the same CSS styling being replicated across the same sections/articles, I have also consolidated some of this styling by adding a similar "class" to the CONTENT section and BENEFITS article.  Example below:

<<<<<<< HEAD
 I have also added a descriptive title of "Horiseon".

 Thank you!
